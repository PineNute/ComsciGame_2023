# Survive game project

## A Prototype of the Unity Project for ICS4UQ-01

This project is a prototype of the surviver game Survive. Sruvive is a game where the user tries to not die to eneimes that spawn on screen in waves over increments of time.
It includes basic elements and concepts  that will be featured in the main game. 

Every part of the project is a sample code that shows how to do the following: 

- Creates a moveable player that a user is able to control
- Creates enemies that spawn and follow the user around the map
- Creates an end game objective that will move the player inbetween scenes
- Creates an interactive environment that the user and enemies are able move around in
- Creates a death mechanic that will respawn the character in a certain position

- 
## Known Issues 
- Enemies will not kill player
- double jumps enables user to fly
- walls can be glitched into
- game objective can be moved around by the enemy
